"""Utilities for build metadata injected at image build time.

The GitHub Actions workflow populates ``BUILD_SHA``, ``BUILD_REF`` and
``BUILD_TIME`` as build arguments when baking the Docker image.  App Runner will
then expose them as environment variables at runtime.  Centralising the logic
for reading and shaping these values makes it easier to reuse from different
routers and to add debugging information when something goes wrong (for
instance, when ``/version`` keeps returning ``"unknown"`` during deployments).
